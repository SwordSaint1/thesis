 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
 is an in detail blueprint that defines how a software needs to be developed, maintained, replaced, modified or updated
* Importance of SDLC 
  - Allows parallel development
  - Serves as a guide
  - Allows you ot evaluate, schedule, and estimate the deliverables
  - Provides a framework for a standard set of activities
  - Ensure on time delivery

 Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
 defines a series of activities conducted to perform Software Testing. 
 Software testing is a process of evaluating the functionality of a software application to find any software bugs.
* Importance od STLC
  - Points out the defects and error
  - Ensure customer reliability and satisfaction
  - Delivers quality products
  - Allows the software to stay in business
  - Prevents from unwanted software failures and hence its cost overhead

                                               (CODING PHASE)
          DESIGN IS WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF SOFTWARE  |  PERFORMED BY TEST TEAM
                   PERFORMED BY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS  | TEST CASES AND DATA IS PREPARED
     VARIOUS TOOLS SUCH AS IDEs, TEXT EDITORS, COMPILERS, DEBUGGERS, INTERPRETERS, etc ARE USED
